            <div className="question">
                <p><strong>Should I apply for a job even if I do not have the required experience?</strong></p>
                <p>The requirements listed in job postings are rarely truly required. Job postings are more like wishlists, or descriptions of a perfect but impossible candidate. Employers have an ideal employee in mind, but they are realistic about the likelihood of that candidate actually existing. They know that the successful candidate may not meet every single item listed in the posting.</p>

            <div className="question">
                <p><strong>Should I apply for jobs in person or online?</strong></p>
                <p>Applying for jobs in person is usually not necessary. Most companies use an online system to manage their hiring process, and trying to bypass this process will not improve your prospects. In fact, many job seekers hoping to stand out by applying in person will show up to an establishment only to be asked to go home and apply online. Whenever a web-based application is available, apply online and save yourself the trip.</p>
